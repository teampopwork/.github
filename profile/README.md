# Who are we?
We are a team of programmers that aim to bring the now outdated Popcap Framework, into the current decade.
<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between PopLib and the original framework?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>We replaced several outdated APIs with:
      <ul>
        <li>Modern equivalents (SDL3 instead of DirectDraw, OpenAL instead of DirectSound)</li>
        <li>Updated versions of existing libraries (vorbis, ogg)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We will implemented tools that are taken for granted today:
      <ul>
        <li>JSON Reader</li>
        <li>Expanded renderer functionality (New blend modes)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
